# Hi, I'm Gavin 👋

Exploring AI systems, workflows, and product thinking.  
Learning by building small experiments in public.

## About Me

I work at the intersection of AI talent and emerging technologies.  
Over time, I've developed a strong interest in how AI-native systems are designed, shipped, and iterated.

This GitHub is where I document that transition —
from observing builders to becoming one.

## What I'm Currently Learning

- AI-native workflows  
- Agent-based tools  
- Automation & system design  
- Shipping small, real projects  

I believe capability compounds through iteration, not theory.

## How I Think

- Design frameworks before features  
- Prefer small, shippable experiments  
- Focus on systems over isolated tools  
- Learn in public

## Why This Exists

This space is not a résumé.

It’s a log of progression —
a place to think, experiment, and gradually build real things.
